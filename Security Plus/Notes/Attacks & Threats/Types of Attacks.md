Attack Vectors & Threat Sources

Types of Attacks

- Cross Site Scripting (XSS):
	- XSS is a web security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, often leading to the theft of sensitive information.  
   
- DNS Poisoning:
	- DNS poisoning is an attack that corrupts the DNS cache, leading to the redirection of legitimate traffic to malicious websites.  
  
- Botnet:
	- A botnet is a network of compromised computers (bots) controlled by a single entity (botmaster) for malicious purposes, such as launching coordinated attacks or sending spam.  
- Ping of Death: 
	- Ping of Death is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack where an attacker sends oversized or malformed ping packets to a target, causing system or network instability.  

- Smurf Attack:
	- In a Smurf attack, an attacker sends a large number of ICMP echo requests (pings) to a network’s broadcast address, causing a flood of responses that can overwhelm and disrupt the targeted network.  

- RAT (Remote Access Trojan):
	- A RAT is a malicious software that allows unauthorized remote access and control of a computer, often used for spying, data theft, or facilitating other cyber attacks.
	- The attacker gets unauthorized access to the computer and can now control it from a remote location.

- Rainbow Table:
	- A Rainbow Table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, usually for cracking password hashes.  

- Buffer Overflow:
	- A Buffer Overflow occurs when too much data is put into a storage area, and it spills into nearby memory.  

- DLL Injection:
	- A DLL (Dynamic Link Language) is a file that contains code and data that multiple programs can use simultaneously.

- Pass the Hash: ^PTH
	- Pass the Hash is a cyberattack technique where an attacker uses the hashed version of a user's password, obtained from one compromised system, to authenticate and gain unauthorized access to other systems without needing to know the actual password.
	
- On-path
	- An on path attack is done by a third-party. An invalid cert message would occur if a man in the attack were to occur.
	  
- Phishing:
	- Attackers use deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into providing sensitive information like usernames and password.
- Malware
	- Malicious software, including viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware, canb
