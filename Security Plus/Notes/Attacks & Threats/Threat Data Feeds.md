STIX and TAXII are standards developed in an effort to improve the prevention and mitigation of cyber-attacks. STIX states the what of threat intelligence, while TAXII defines how that information is relayed. Unlike previous methods of sharing, STIX and TAXII are machine-readable and therefore easily automated.

STIX is the Threat Intelligence Format (Structure), and TAXII is the transport for ingesting or moving threat intelligence
