#### Scalability
Scalability means that the costs involved in supplying the service to more users are linear. For example, if the number of users doubles in a scalable system, the costs to maintain the same level of service would also double (or less than double). If it costs me than double, the system is less scalable.
#### Elasticity

^elasticity

Elasticity refers to the systemâ€™s ability to handle changes in demand in real time. A system with high elasticity will not experience loss of service or performance if demand suddenly doubles (or triples, or quadruples). Conversely it may be important for the system to be able to reduce costs when demand is lose.
